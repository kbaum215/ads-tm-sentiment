    "Q: Overall, which artist has the higher average sentiment per song? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: The artist with the higher sentiment per song is Kanye West, by a mile. This means Kanye's songs, on average, have a higher positive sentiment. Nonetheless, Joni still has a slightly positive sentiment in her songs. The score can be less than zero, and I would imagine artists such as Korn or Slipknot would be in the negative, given that their songs are generally very negative in their lyrical content. It does crack me up that Kanye's is so high, at least compared to Joni. It is also a little surprising, as I can think of many Kanye songs that are negative in their lyrical content. "

    "Q: For your first artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: Results below, starting with Kanye West. The results are close to what I was thinking, actually. The song selection is from the first 25 songs of Kanye West's catalogue, which is primarily the album \"College Dropout.\" This is a socially conscious album, before Kanye was as experimental in his music as he became in the 2010s. The driver of the negative sentiment are \"All Falls Down\" and \"Jesus Walks.\" I specifically had \"Jesus Walks\" and also \"We Don't Care\" as songs that would likely show up in the negative sentiment, though \"We Don't Care\" did not crack the top 3. \"Jesus Walks\" is a song critical of modern society and uses dramatic language from the bible to talk about the world as it was in 2004 (the fear of Terrorism being predominant). \"All Falls Down\" is also one of my favorites, and talks about the problems with consumer culture in America. \"Slow Jamz\" is the top highest sentiment song, and is very much an R&B song featuring none other than Jamie Foxx. It is a song featuring romance and is a \"feel good\" pleasant song to listen to. "

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forthJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' withSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"[No ID:]\"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer[Hiphop:]\"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back thenI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hiphop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"[JAY-Z:]\"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said[JAY-Z:]\"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"[JAY-Z:]\"So what you think of this?\"And I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to[Mother:]\"Come on, let's just go\"...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up[Mother:]\"Kanye, baby, we're here\"...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX[Hiphop:]\"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"[Dame:]\"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"[Dame:]\"Jay got classics, G.\"You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"[JAY-Z:]\"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"Yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man[Jessica:]\"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad[Joe:]\"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"Dame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"[Dame:]\"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wowI got 11 plaques on my walls right nowYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"[Dame:]\"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"[Dame:]\"It's actually kinda hot.\"Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"[Dame:]\"You don't wanna catch a brick\"\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"Oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"[Mel:]\"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"So won't you raise your glass, won't youSo won't you raise your glass, won't youSo won't you raise your glass, won't youSo won't you raise your glass, won't you\n",

    "A: Joni Mitchell writes in her best albums about melancholy things. She is sort of a melancholy person who, despite her great artistry, is known to be difficult to be around. She does occasionally write about positive things. The song \"Dawntreader\", as well as many of her early songs before she started to find her voice on the album \"Clouds\", were very much inspired by the peace-loving hippies of the 1960s. Her first album \"Song to a Seagull\" is basically a snoozer copy of 1960s soft rock inspired by LSD. There are words about \"love\", \"treasure\", and \"smiling.\" I am not as intimately familiar with the songs in the negative sentiment list, but I see that the top song is \"Nathan La Franeer.\" Words like \"never\", \"furrowed\", and \"burglar\" seem to drive the negative sentiment of this song. \n"
